Hello,
in this short (and first!) post on this blog I would like to show you how to make a sprite face the mouse cursor. This is quite useful for aiming in top-down shooters and similar games.
You can see an example of this in this gif.

<div
    style={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
      }}
>
    <video preload="true" autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
        <source src="/image/rotation.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/image/rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

Now let's talk about the code. I tried various solutions found on the web, but most of them don't work, work sometimes or work badly. Luckily the easiest solution is also the best one! I found it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XdqA3xbP2A) and it is made by Danndx.

### The code
Here's the full code:
``` cs
Vector3 mousePosition = new Vector3 (Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition));

Vector2 directionToLookAt = new Vector2(
    mousePosition.x - transform.position.x,
    mousePosition.y - transform.position.y
    );

transform.up = directionToLookAt;
```

If you are in a hurry you can just copy-paste this code into a script on the object you want to rotate and then call it in the function Update. 
But what does this code actually do?

### Explaining the code
``` cs
Vector3 mousePosition = new Vector3 (Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition));
```
Here we get the current mouse position, we translate it into "world coordinates", which are actually usable, and then store it in a Vector3 variable. 

``` cs
Vector2 directionToLookAt = new Vector2(
    mousePosition.x - transform.position.x,
    mousePosition.y - transform.position.y
    );
```
Create a new Vector2 and store the difference between the mouse position and the object position. We don't actually need the z axis, so we won't use a Vector3 this time.

``` cs
transform.up = directionToLookAt;
```
[transform.up](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-up.html) *"Manipulates a GameObjectâ€™s position on the Y axis (green axis) of the transform in world space"*, according to Unity's Docs. 
Basically, we rotate the Y axis of the object.

That's all!
